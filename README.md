# Renpy8 Animalese
Zach Coleman (ztc0611) adapted HenryIsHuman's Animalese script to work with Renpy using Jiaaro (James Robert)'s Pydub. And now I came in and made it work with Renpy 8.0.0/Python 3. 
Check out everyone below!
* https://github.com/jiaaro
* https://github.com/ztc0611

Installing is the same as ztc0611's original. Just drag over:
* The full "pydub" folder
* the full "audio" folder
* The character callbacks in script.rpy, modified for the names of your own characters.
* speak.rpy
